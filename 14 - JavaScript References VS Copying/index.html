    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Wesley'
    console.log('original:' + players, 'reference: ' + team)

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice()
    team2[0] = 'Lux'
    console.log('original:' + players, 'reference: ' + team, 'copy: ' + team2)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]

    console.log('original:' + players, 'reference: ' + team, 'copy: ' + team4)

    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    console.log(team5)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person
    captain.age = 99
    console.log(person, captain)

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 75 })
    console.log(person, captain, captain2)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const captain3 = {...person}
    console.log(captain3)

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
